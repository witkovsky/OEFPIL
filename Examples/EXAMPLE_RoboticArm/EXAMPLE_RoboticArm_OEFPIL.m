%% EXAMPLE_RobotArmSetting_OEFPIL
%
% This example is inspired by the paper [1], submitted for publication in
% Measurement Science Review by Krepelka, Schovanek, Tucek, Hrabovsky, and
% Jane in 2023 (accepted for publication in 2024):
%
% - The paper addresses the positioning of glued parts by robots in the
%   manufacturing process of automotive headlights, requiring high precision
%   and efficiency.
% - The authors propose a mathematical method to optimize the robot arm
%   setting, ensuring the closest contact of the glued parts based on the
%   position of the nominal and control points on the contact surfaces of the
%   two joined parts.
% - The method involves finding the minimum of an objective function that
%   combines the sum of squared deviations of the position of the control
%   points from the nominal points and the sum of squared deviations from the
%   root mean square deviation.
% - The method can be applied to different types of transformations, such as
%   translation followed by rotation or rotation followed by translation, and
%   different orders of rotation axes.
% - The paper presents numerical simulations and a practical example to
%   demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.
%
% Motivated by the paper [1], the example RobotArmSetting_OEFPIL provides
% an illustration of estimating parameters of interest and their
% uncertainties for a robot arm setting. The objective is to ensure the
% contact of assembly parts based on the initial control position (measured
% data) and the nominal points.
%
% In this scenario, the data consists of measured 3D coordinates (along
% with a specified uncertainty matrix) of points on the assembly part
% (e.g., automotive headlight part) at its initial (starting) position and
% the given target coordinates.
%
% The assumption is that the robot arm can reach the target by making
% translation followed by rotation (or rotation followed by translation).
% The required translation is specified by a 3-dimensional vector, and the
% required rotations (about axes x, y, and z) are specified by the rotation
% angles alpha, beta, and gamma. Thus, the parameters of interest are the
% three rotation angles and the 3-dimensional translation vector.
%
% For solving this problem, the example suggests using a regression model of
% direct measurements with nonlinear constraints on its parameters. It is an
% Errors-in-Variable (EIV) model, as the required relations are expressed by
% the nonlinear function of the mean values of the measurements and the
% model parameters of interest.
%
% The positions of the initial coordinates of the specified m points on the
% assembly part are modeled as direct measurements (with errors): 
%   X = mu_x + epsilon_x, Y = mu_y + epsilon_y, Z = mu_z + epsilon_z.
% The complete knowledge about uncertainties is expressed by the uncertainty
% (3*m x 3*m)-dimensional matrix U, with the structure specified for each
% block of the matrix.
%
% Important parts of the model are the required (nonlinear) constraints on
% its unknown parameters mu_x, mu_y, mu_z, alpha, beta, gamma, and the
% vector of translation (the required translations in each direction)
% specified by translation_x, translation_y, and translation_z. 
% 
% The following formulation requires that the expected values of the
% measured coordinates are first translated and then rotated about z-axis,
% y-axis, and x-axes (in this specific ordering), such that such
% transformed coordinates are equal to the targeted values.
%
% In fact, the q-dimensional vector of restrictions, f, is specified as:
%   f = vec( ([mu_x, mu_y, mu_z] 
%       - ones(m, 1) * [translation_x, translation_y, translation_z]') * R_zyx  
%       - [target_x, target_y, target_z] )
% where R_zyx = R_x * R_y * R_z is the rotation matrix with the first
% rotation with angle gamma about the axis z, the second rotation with
% angle beta about the axis y, and the third rotation with angle alpha
% about the axis x). The (m x 3)-matrix XYZ0 = [target_x, target_y,
% target_z] is a given matrix of target coordinates.
%
% Here, the OEFPIL algorithm [2] is presented as a suitable tool for fitting
% measured data and estimating the required parameters of interest together
% with their uncertainties.

%% Compare the transformed data with the target values
% 
% In this context, we assume that the observed data were generated
% through a rotation and translation process from the original target
% values. The mean values of the measurements, mu = [mu_x mu_y mu_z], are
% given by the equation:
%
%   mu = Target * R_xyz' + ones(m, 1) * translation'
%
% where 'translation' is a 3-dimensional column vector, R_xyz = R_z*R_y*R_x 
% is the rotation matrix used, with the first rotation (alpha) about the
% x-axis, the second rotation (beta) about the y-axis, and the third
% rotation (gamma) about the z-axis.
%
% It's important to note that the rotation of a 3D column vector, xyzRot,
% is given by Rxyz * xyz.
%
% However, in our case, we deal with transformed equations because the data
% and mu are represented as (m x 3) matrices, with the 3D coordinates of
% the measured points provided in rows. Consequently, the reverse
% transformation to obtain the Target values from the means of observed
% data involves the following steps:
%
%   (mu - ones(m, 1) * translation') = Target * R_xyz'
%   (mu - ones(m, 1) * translation') = Target * (R_z * R_y * R_x)'
%   (mu - ones(m, 1) * translation') = Target * R_x' * R_y' * R_z'
%
% To identify the Target, we multiply both sides of the equation by the
% inverse rotations. Notably, R_x' * R_x = eye(3), R_y' * R_y = eye(3), and
% R_z' * R_z = eye(3). Thus, we obtain:
%
%   (mu - ones(m, 1) * translation') * R_z * R_y * R_x 
%                                    = Target * R_x' * R_y' * R_z'
%   (mu - ones(m, 1) * translation') * R_z * R_y * R_x = Target
% or
%   Target = (mu - ones(m, 1) * translation') * Rz_ * R_y * R_x
%   Target = (mu - ones(m, 1) * translation') * R_xyz
